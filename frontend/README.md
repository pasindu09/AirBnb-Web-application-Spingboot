## Commits

This repository adheres to a structured commit message convention to enhance readability and maintainability. Here's an overview of the key commit types:

- **feat:** Introduces a new feature to the application.
- **fix:** Addresses a bug or issue identified in the codebase.
- **docs:** Encompasses changes made to documentation, such as updates, additions, or corrections.
- **style:** Covers formatting adjustments, whitespace changes, or fixing minor inconsistencies like missing semicolons.
- **refactor:** Represents code structure improvements without altering functionality. This can involve code organization, renaming variables or functions, or improving readability.
- **test:** Introduces new tests or updates existing tests to ensure code quality and maintainability.
- **chore:** Encompasses changes that don't directly affect the application's functionality, such as updating build tasks, package manager configurations, or dependency versions.

**Optional Improvement:**

Consider adopting a more comprehensive commit message convention like Conventional Commits ([https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.4/)). This approach provides a standard format for commit messages, including type, scope (optional), and a clear description of the change, making it easier to generate changelogs, automate workflows, and collaborate effectively.

By following these guidelines and potentially adopting a more detailed convention, you'll ensure clear and consistent commit messages that benefit you and your team in the long run.## Contributions
